### Cookies placed and opt-out

This site places a small text file (a "cookie") on your computer when you visit it. This allows us to measure the number of visits and understand which pages are most viewed.

### This site does not display a cookie consent banner, why?

That's right, you didn't have to click on a block that covers half the page to say that you agree with the placement of cookies â€” even if you don't know what that means!

Nothing exceptional, no special privilege related to a .gouv.fr. We simply respect the law, which says that some audience tracking tools, correctly configured to respect privacy, are exempt from prior authorization.

For this, we use Matomo, a free tool, set up to comply with the "Cookies" recommendation of the CNIL. This means that your IP address, for example, is anonymized before being recorded. It is therefore impossible to associate your visits to this site with your person.

### I contribute to enriching your data, can I access it?

Of course! Usage statistics for the majority of our products, including beta.gouv.fr, are freely accessible on [stats.data.gouv.fr](https://stats.data.gouv.fr).
